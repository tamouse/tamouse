- 😄 Pronouns: She/her/hers, they/them are also good
- :computer: Software engineer
- :paintbrush: Watercolourist
- :woman: Mom to two wonderful, grown women that are changing the world
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote my first software app in the summer of 1969, a lunar landing game written in BASIC and stored on punched paper tape, using a [tty-33 teletype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33)!

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- The Grateful Garment Project <https://gratefulgarment.org>
- [#causeascene bootcamp](https://hashtagcauseascene.com/bootcamp/), and becoming an [anti-racist](https://hashtagcauseascene.com/guiding-principles/)
- helping traditionally underserved and marginalized people wanting to get in software development, learning technology and how to navigate these spaces that have traditionally been hostile

## My guiding principles

Adopted from [#causeascene](https://hashtagcauseascene.com/guiding-principles/):

1. Tech is Not Neutral, Nor is it Apolitical
2. Intention without Strategy is Chaos
3. Lack of Inclusion is a Risk/Crisis Management Issue
4. Prioritize the Most Vulnerable
