### Hi there!! 👋

I'm a ***retired*** software engineer recovering from the rat race and hellscape that modern web companies have become by focusing my attention on creating art instead of creating software.

Adopted from [Guiding Principles](https://www.kimcrayton.com/guiding-principles/) by [Kim Crayton, The Antiracist Economist](https://www.kimcrayton.com/)
