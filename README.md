## :compass: My guiding principles
Adopted from [Guiding Principles](https://www.kimcrayton.com/guiding-principles/) by [Kim Crayton, The Antiracist Economist](https://www.kimcrayton.com/)

1. Tech is Not Neutral, Nor is it Apolitical
2. Intention without Strategy is Chaos
3. Lack of Inclusion is a Risk/Crisis Management Issue  
    ... _and lastly and most importantly:_
4. **Prioritize the Most Vulnerable**
